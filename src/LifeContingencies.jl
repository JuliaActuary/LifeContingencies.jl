A `Life` object containing the necessary assumptions for contingent maths related to a single life. Use with a `LifeContingency` to do many actuarial present value calculations. 

Keyword arguments:
- `mort` pass a mortality vector, which is an array of applicable mortality rates indexed by attained age
- `issue_age` is the assumed issue age for the `SingleLife` and is the basis of many contingency calculations.
- `alive` Default value is `true`. Useful for joint insurances with different status on the lives insured.
- `fractional_assump`. Default value is `Uniform()`. This is a `DeathDistribution` from the `MortalityTables.jl` package and is the assumption to use for non-integer ages/times.

# Examples
